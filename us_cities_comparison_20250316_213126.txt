You know what's fire, though? A good ol' fashioned Tim Hortons run at midnight, even when you're feelin' like you're gonna burn up. That's the life, fam! And when I'm back in Surrey, I'm reppin' my local vibes, you know?

But for real though, from what I heard, Houston's a whole 'nother world, ya get me? It's like, super big and hot, fam. You gotta keep it movin', 'cause the traffic's straight up crazy!
